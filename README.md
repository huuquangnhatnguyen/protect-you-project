# Project You Interface - Seasonal Health Companion
###  Huu Quang Nhat Nguyen

This project is aim to create a smart device for displaying a seasonal health and nutrition that will be placed on a fridge door. The goal is to provide household members with quick, at-a-glance information about common winter illnesses, key advisory nutrients, and seasonal produce to incorporate into meals. 

## Why this project was made?

Seasonal changes throughout the year can significantly impact health and wellbeing, bringing a range of unique challenges. From the prevalence of common winter illnesses like the flu and colds, to the nutrient deficiencies caused by reduced sunlight exposure, to the heat-related issues of summer - each season presents its own set of concerns that can disrupt daily life and cause unease for households. This comprehensive seasonal health and nutrition dashboard aims to empower families to stay resilient year-round by providing clear, actionable information about common seasonal diseases, key advisory nutrients, and fresh seasonal ingredients to incorporate into meals. The goal is to raise awareness, encourage proactive health measures, and foster better wellness habits that can minimize the disruption caused by the ebbs and flows of seasonal changes, enabling households to maintain optimal health and wellness no matter the time of year.


## User Needs and Design Requirements

### User Needs 

- Users, especially parents, need information about all possible common seasonal diseases to protect their children
- Users need to improve the quality of the meals by adding necessary nutrients from natural sources
- Users want to get updated with health care news to prepare their family with the best measures and prevent from being infected by any outbreaks

### Design Requirements
The design should be simple and easy-to-use. It should show the information straight forward without many steps or buttons. Last but not least, the layout should be clean with eye-catching colors used

## Future 
- 2nd device enables user to access the database anywhere or receive notificaion
- More age group oriented features
- Back end implemented to get live information and updates for each season

## Use of AI
I utilized Github's copilot coding feature in VS, as well as chatGPT to help me doing styling and create mock data. It sped up the coding process by skipping past much of the lookup process and helped with debugging. 

## Libraries [include source links and explain what they were used for]
